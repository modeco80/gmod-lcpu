# riscv

This is a simple RISC-V RV32IMA emulation library.

This is based off [cnlohr/mini-rv32ima](https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima), but:

- Rewritten in C++20 (because I like sanity)
- Cleaned up vastly
- Moved *ALL* device and MMIO code to seperate interfaces

Depends on lucore.

# Usage

TBD (if this is moved to another repo). See the lcpu project
