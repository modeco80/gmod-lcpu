# LCPU

LCPU is an alternative CPU core addon for GMod/Wiremod.

It provides:

- A standard RISC-V architechure (rv32ima) CPU core, implemented in native code
	- No wiremod native code embargos here!
- Interoperation with the Wiremod addon (and addons which implement Wiremod integration)

# Building Native Module

TODO: Steps to build the LCPU native module on Windows and Linux

# Installation

This repository is set up in the exact directory structure to be a Legacy Addon; therefore once you have built the native module (TODO), adding it to a server should work fine.
